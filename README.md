### Bareboned PHP 7 with Composer set-up
Want to quickly test a new feature, practise a new design pattern or just create a new project for yourself?
Well this probably means you'll have to set-up your project with the most basic packages available: PHPUnit & Composer.

And don't forget that you'll have to set-up _yet another_ docker config.. It's the same thing over and over again.

This repository tries to get you started with just 2 commands - just run:

- `git pull git@github.com:KakaCarrotCake/barebone-php-composer.git`
- `composer install`

And BAM, A new - bareboned - PHP instance is ready for you to be played with!

You can also run a docker environment in an instant by running the following command in the `/docker` directory:

- `docker-compose up`

### Included in this repository are the following packages/software:
- Docker
- PHPUnit
- Composer
-- PHP 7
-- MySQL
-- Nginx
